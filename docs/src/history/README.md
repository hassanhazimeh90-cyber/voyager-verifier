# History Overview

*This section is currently under development as part of Phase 2.*

The history feature provides local tracking of all your verification jobs:

- **How History Works** - Automatic tracking with SQLite database
- **Viewing History** - List and filter past verifications
- **Filtering** - Filter by status, network, date
- **Rechecking Jobs** - Batch update pending jobs
- **Statistics** - View verification success rates
- **Cleanup** - Manage old records

## Quick Start

For now, see the [history command reference](../commands/history.md).

Full history documentation will be added in Phase 2.
